# Usage
Because PRIMAP2 builds on xarray, all xarray functionality is available
right away.
Additional functionality is provided in the `primap2` package and
in the `pr` namespace on xarray objects.
In this section, we will show the fundamentals of how to work with primap2 data,
namely selecting data from datasets and inspecting metadata and properties.
