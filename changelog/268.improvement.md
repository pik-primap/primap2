* Added sorting of metadata keys and data values to the interchange format on-disk files.
  This means interchange format files written with this version or higher of primap2 should
  only change if the metadata or data values change, not due to random re-ordering of
  keys. However, interchange format files written with older versions are of course
  unsorted, so most likely they will all change if just read and re-written without
  changes using this version or primap2.
